// A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. This technique allows a function to call another function after completing its task, making it a common method for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

// Promises
// A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a cleaner, more readable, and more manageable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks.
