// The XMLHttpRequest object is a JavaScript object that provides a way to interact with servers through HTTP requests. It is commonly used in AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to update web pages asynchronously by exchanging data with a server behind the scenes. This means that web pages can be updated without reloading the entire page.

// How XMLHttpRequest is Used in AJAX
// Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the XMLHttpRequest object in an AJAX request:

// Create an XMLHttpRequest Object:

// The first step is to create a new instance of the XMLHttpRequest object.
// Configure the Request:

// Use the open method to specify the type of request (e.g., GET or POST), the URL, and whether the request should be asynchronous.
// Send the Request:

// Use the send method to send the request to the server.
// Handle the Response:

// Define a callback function for the onreadystatechange event to handle the server's response.
