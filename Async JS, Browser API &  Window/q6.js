// he localStorage and sessionStorage APIs are part of the Web Storage API and are used to store data on the client side in web development. They both provide a way to persist data in the browser, but they differ in terms of data lifespan and scope.

// localStorage:

// Purpose: The localStorage API is used for storing data that should persist across browser sessions. This means that data stored in localStorage remains available even after the browser is closed and reopened. Itâ€™s useful for storing information that should be retained over a long period of time, such as user preferences or settings.

// sessionStorage:

// Purpose: The sessionStorage API is used for storing data that should only persist for the duration of the page session. A page session lasts as long as the browser tab is open, including page reloads and restores. However, when the tab or window is closed, the data is cleared. This is useful for storing temporary data that should not be retained beyond the current session, such as form data or temporary user input.
