// JavaScript developers have access to several common Browser APIs that enhance web functionality. The **DOM API** allows 
// manipulation of HTML and CSS, enabling dynamic updates to web pages. The **Fetch API** provides a modern way to make network 
// requests, replacing older methods like XMLHttpRequest with a more powerful and flexible approach. The **Geolocation API** enables
//  web applications to access the user's geographical location, which can be useful for location-based services. The **Web Storage
//   API**, including LocalStorage and SessionStorage, offers ways to store data on the client side, allowing data persistence between sessions or page reloads. The **Canvas API** is used for drawing graphics and animations directly onto a web page, supporting features like game development and data visualization. Lastly, the **Web Audio API** provides sophisticated audio processing capabilities, allowing developers to create, manipulate, and analyze sound in web applications. 
// These APIs collectively enhance web applications, providing greater interactivity and functionality.
